first week back from protected vacation <br>
- not too bad of a week <br>
- a couple of teams are going live though <br>
- jen arrived! <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- fairly chill week work-wise <br>
- a bit less jittery (didn't really feel any "sunday scaries") <br>
- happy that jen is here <br>
- still feels like time is frozen, stuck in a sea of monotony <br>
- still triggered by one team <br>
- progress on remaining apps feels sluggish <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- have a hunch the next couple of weeks might get really busy with multiple teams going live <br>
- try to stay at peace / not so easily angered or flustered <br>
- try to progress apps when I can <br>

A successful businessman on vacation was at the pier of a small coastal village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The businessman complimented the fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.
<br>
The fisherman proudly replied, “Every morning, I go out in my boat for 30 minutes to fish. I’m the best fisherman in the village”.
<br>
The businessman, perplexed, then asks the fisherman “If you’re the best, why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish? What do you do the rest of the day?”
<br>
The fisherman replied “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, spend quality time with my wife, and every evening we stroll into the village to drink wine and play guitar with our friends. I have a full and happy life.”
<br>
The businessman scoffed, “I am successful CEO and have a talent for spotting business opportunities. I can help you be more successful. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats with many fishermen. Instead of selling your catch to just your friends, you can scale to sell fish to thousands. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to the big city, where you can oversee your growing empire.”
<br>
The fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”
<br>
To which the businessman replied, “15 – 20 years.”
<br>
“But what then?” Asked the fisherman.
<br>
The businessman laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
<br>
“Millions – then what?”
<br>
The businessman said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, spend time with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your friends.”

reflections on 2020 (written on 12/31/20) <br>
- a year dominated by work and COVID <br>
- looking back on old texts, I do think I have grown since college, in a maturing way <br>
- generally more seasoned of a person <br>
- I would like to think I am more emotionally resilient <br>
- have been remote/WFH/quarantining for around 10 months now <br>
- a lot of what I learned came out of the struggles of work: learning to handle adversity, not being in control <br>
- in a word: resilience <br>
<br>
chronological breakdown of 2020 <br>
- 1. Jan-Mar: coming off tough work project, into birthday <br>
- 2. Mar-Jun: COVID starting (what the heck is going on?), living with Nan and Aaron, TFT <br>
- 3. Jun-Sep: came home, very tough work project, combined with stress about law school apps; extreme feelings of time scarcity <br>
- 4. Sep-Dec: progressively chiller, work not as bad, submitted law school apps, lots of Discord/League/ARAM/NBA <br>
<br>
things I did <br>
- read Bible daily since last New Year (read Genesis through 1 Samuel) <br>
- hit Diamond 2 in TFT; played a lot of ARAM; started Valorant <br>
- read a few books: The Defining Decade, Little Fires Everywhere, Becoming <br>
- moved back home (temporarily) <br>
- lots of walks <br>
<br>
what I'm looking forward to in 2021 <br>
- quitting investment banking <br>
- starting law school (COVID permitting) or a new job (hopefully healthcare startup related) <br>
- being with friends and in community again <br>
- basically, a change of scenery <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- chill week with New Year's <br>
- talked with fam about plans for pest control business <br>
<br>
+++ Pest Control Meeting Notes 1/1/21 +++ <br>
- a few possible paths: <br>
- 1. sell business <br>
- 2. partner/merge business (potentially with Wylie business) <br>
- 3. run out the business, then stop <br>
- 4. hire technicians and formalize the business <br>
- plan for now: try to hire technicians by October; run business until 65; then look to partner <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- made a new friend at the Murphy tennis courts // went to hit by myself, but another guy there was too, so I asked to play together <br>
- I have a strong sense of how things "should" be, and deviations from that are a source of discontentment. examples below: <br>
- - on Friday night, I "should" be socializing or with friends (over discord games or whatever); if not, feel sad and lonely <br>
- - on Thursday night, I "should" get off at a reasonable time and have time to rest; working late into the night very upsetting <br>
- - on Saturday night, I "should" be using time to spend with dad; if I'm doing something in my room, I feel guilty <br>
- - I "should" have the chance to go on walks with my parents, to watch sermons on Sunday, to eat meals peacefully, to rest and unplug from work <br>
- finished reading Brave New World <br>
- a challenging week toward the back end, working on an IPO pitch, went to bed at 5am ET Thursday night; felt trapped, stressed, dreamed about work <br>
- things that made me happy: sleeping in, cooking noodles with dad, facetiming jen, first snowfall of the year on Sunday! <br>
- watched a relevant sermon today about trusting in God amidst uncertainty and anxiety <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- first wave of HLS acceptances released tomorrow; fingers crossed; a bit nervous // keeping my peace either way <br>
- hopefully calmer after submission of IPO pitch tomorrow <br>
<br>

1/14/21 (special edition entry) <br>
<br>
Today I got into Stanford Law School. It was almost noon, and I was doing work, when I got the call. Upon seeing the 650 area code, I paused, then answered. It was the dean of the school. The phone call ended up lasting 4 minutes, but it felt like forever. The whole time I was pretty shaken and pacing back and forth in my room. After much anticipation, I was delightfully shook. <br>
<br>
People joke that getting into law school is the happiest part of law school. I definitely felt happy - happier than I felt getting into college. At the same time, life goes on. Still more work to do, and the same desires that affected me the day before still affect me today: longing for community, appreciating my family, enjoying good food and company. Don't get me wrong. I am very very excited, for the education, for the people I'll meet, for the opportunities I don't even know of yet; for Stanford! But, I have been praying that whether I get good or bad news during this application cycle, that I would keep my peace. <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>

- caught up with some friends (David, Xindi, Deanna, Chris) and told them about Stanford <br>
- lots of valorant and crossword puzzles with friends <br>
- fishing was good to get outdoors <br>

1/25/21 (written on a Monday because yesterday was challenging) <br>
<img src ="jan23schedule.jpeg" height="200">
<img src ="jan25tea.jpeg" height="200">
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- a thoroughly tough week of work (weekdays plus Sunday yesterday). started and ended rough <br>
- frustrated with work and the people at work, who seem unreasonable or are not doing their part <br>
- frustrated with the culture of banking - the equation is: <br>
- - assuming we achieve X, analysts then work as much as needed to achieve that (late nights, weekends, inefficient iterations) <br>
- - instead, it should be assuming a finite analyst amount of labor (assuming sustainability), what is the best we can achieve? <br>
- took today Monday off. sent an email in the early morning: "Due to personal health reasons, will be offline today. Thank you for your understanding" <br>
- - physical health: have not been sleeping well due to stress, have been experiencing chest tightness/pain and shortness of breath <br>
- - mental health: frustrated, stressed <br>
- - part of it is making a statement: I dare you to challenge me on this <br>
- - hopefully the start of a conversation on wellbeing. maybe not. <br>
- - how I spent the day: slept in, cleaned bathroom, vacuumed room, ate chipotle, looked at law school financial aid info, played tennis, dinner with dad, washed dishes <br>
- with that said, Saturday was really, really nice (see photo). only wish that I had more time, not how I spent it <br>
- got into upenn, uchicago, and columbia law (full-ride @ columbia)... don't think I've really processed this <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- funny how last week I said "try to stay calm with work"; I guess that's my hope for this week too <br>
<br>
<br>
1/31//21 <br>
(written one or two days ago) my dad said that during hard times, it can be helpful to think "at least..." <br>
i.e., even though X is bad, at least Y <br>
so here goes for this week. context is had a follow-on blow up Thursday night, launching Monday <br>
- at least it's a follow-on and not an M+A process <br>
- at least diligence calls were suggested for Sunday, not Saturday <br>
- at least we get to do abbreviated memos <br>
- at least it's a good team <br>
- at least it's an interesting company doing good science <br>
- at least the company is scheduling around pacific time, meaning less early meetings <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- thinking about writing these entries on Saturdays instead of Sundays <br>
- recent Sundays have been so busy with work, they feel like a new week, not a point of pause and reflection <br>
- this week I abruptly took two days off for personal health (chest tightness and pain, shortness of breath): physical and mental health <br>
- got rolled off my least favorite team, but haven't had a chance to process this and be happy about it yet <br>
- follow-on deal blew up Thursday night, launching tomorrow (Monday)  morning <br>
- feel like I just can't catch a break <br>
- nonetheless, still trying to remember the good things <br>
- - took two days off <br>
- - played Valorant and catan with friends <br>
- - went to Bob Woodruff park with friends <br>
- - quality time with dad <br>
- - connected with my sister talking about mental health <br>
- - scheduled a mental health appointment <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- please let there be rest <br>

- good long Sat: woke up at 530am to go fishing, played tennis in the afternoon, discord and games with friends in the evening <br>

- bit checked out at work <br>
- one of my fave associates leaving <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>
- taking a 4 day weekend: Friday off for Chinese New Year, into Monday President's day holiday <br>
- don't really remember the work week, which I guess is good because it means I'm relatively distanced from it <br>
- thankful to spend Chinese New Year at home with family, and taking days off from work <br>
- also Valentine's day this week, glad to spend it with jen virtually <br>
- even more jaded and unmotivated with work than before; feel like I can or should quit any day <br>
- think I have had too much discord games, especially valorant. need to take a break from it <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- one more day off tomorrow <br>
- hopefully fairly chill <br>

- no power, no internet, no cell service <br>
- I kind of liked it; time froze; just chilling with fam; reading books; sleep early and wake up late <br>
- started and finished reading Interior Chinatown <br>
- originally took last Friday off for CNY, turned into not working for 9 days due to the outages <br>
- feels harder and harder to get back into the work of investment banking <br>
- oh, and spent real life money on a valorant celestian phantom skin lol <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- well, back to work after what has unintentionally amounted to the length of a protected vacation <br>
- try to keep my calm despite all my misgivings of working in investment banking, trauma(?) from overwork, the work life culture, etc. <br>

turned 24! <br>
<br>
reflections on turning 24 <br>
I think as I've grown older, and especially this year, I don't really look forward to birthdays much anymore. I think I would prefer to stop growing up now, and in general, growing up seems tough. Communities and friendships are less easily accessible, you have to start taking on greater life responsibilities, and you have to craft your own path. Plus, your parents are getting older. Nonetheless, I am thankful for birthdays as a time to reflect, a time to be grateful, and a time to connect with friends.<br>
<br>
things I'm thankful for as I turn 24 <br>
- family (mom and dad, sister, brother-in-law, and niece) that love me and support me, and have sacrificed to provide for a better life for me <br>
- a loving, kind, and thoughtful girlfriend <br>
- friends (from childhood, from high school, from college, from discord games, and even a few from work) <br>
- a job that pays well and has good benefits <br>
- acceptances to Stanford and Harvard law schools, among others <br>
- a general feeling of confidence as I look ahead to the near future; even if not always happy or optimistic, a general sense that the future outlook is at least alright <br>
- quitting ib in a few months <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- not too bad a week after being offline a whole week due to Texas storm outages <br>
- thankful for friends and a birthday to reminisce on the past year and years <br>
- just starting to get inklings of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with work <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- try to find a little joy each day; try to have peace at work; try to have kindness with friends; try to have thoughtfulness with family and loved ones <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>
- made the decision to take the policy research job <br>
- work was fine <br>
- two notable events <br>
- - 1. shooting in Atlanta of primarily asian women <br>
- - 2. GS survey of terrible working conditions got reported in all the major news outlets <br>
- for both of these, what will change? I do not know or see anything <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- quit and unquit my job (long story short, would have been required to take a month long garden period) <br>
- - 1) did not want to reduce the already-short time at the research place <br>
- - 2) did not want to be idle for a month yet, want to take that time right before starting school <br>
- - thinking of this as a resetting point; 3 more months until the finish line; basically just an internship's worth of time left <br>
- - my friend says "the best days are still ahead" - I think this is true, especially as we get closer to the end <br>
- pretty chill week of work <br>
- glad to have gone fishing with my parents yesterday <br>
- the notion of making plans for the wedding in May and returning to NYC is exciting <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- none, to be honest <br>
- Good Friday and Easter next weekend <br>

Good Friday and Easter weekend <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- chill week plus 3 day weekend <br>
- honestly, feeling ennui and a bit lonely - not really doing much or have much planned <br>
- at the very least, time is passing by, and bringing me closer to when I quit GS <br>
- happy spending time with jen, watching movies/TV/youtube, doing avengers/fast food tier lists <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- try to hold it down following this nice long weekend <br>
- request protected vacation for May <br>

<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- committed to SLS; turning down HLS was harder than I thought, did not like the feeling of disappointing parents <br>
- had an honest conversation with mom and dad about not wanting to disappoint them; they are honest with me with their preferences (HLS), yet still support me in my decisions (SLS) <br>
- I think I will be happier at Stanford <br>
- chill work week <br>
- last weekend at home <br>
- really enjoyed fishing Saturday morning: perfect weather (60s, cloudy, no wind), nice pace of catches <br>
- I think I need to get better at making decisions: taking it to God, having more conviction <br>
- I think I really care about making my parents happy, maybe to the point where I lose a bit of my own independence and thinking <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- one more week until protected vacation, wahooo! <br>

1/14/21 (special edition entry) <br>
<br>
After 11 months, tomorrow I am once again leaving home. It is the longest stretch I have lived at home since high school. I am so thankful to have spent time at home with my family during such a weird time. It is a moment of reflection of a few threads during this period: <br>
- law school: applying, interviewing, getting acceptances, and making a decision <br>
- work: really painful summer, extreme feelings of time scarcity, anxiety, anger <br>
- fishing: with dad, for peace, to get away from work, to spend time with dad <br>
- tennis: started with a FB post, playing tennis again with friends <br>
- walks: with mom and dad, every night, after dinner <br>
- discord: playing league then valorant and making new friends on discord <br>

- As this era of NYC / GS / banking comes to a close, I think this will be my last regular weekly entry. It has been a place to record and see the evolution of my thoughts, especially during the harder times. I may add additional entries again from time to time (maybe when I leave NYC or start school). TBD. <br>
<br>
<br>
Pre-SLS Thoughts <br>
<br>
I think it is fair to say that I definitely had (have) a lot of misigivings about law school. The cost ($, time) and opportunity cost (lost income) are immediate and concrete, whereas the potential benefits seem nebulous and further away. Plus, there is added stress from classes, job recruiting, moving to a new place and community, etc. I think as the date gets closer, the anxiety is starting to outweigh the excitement. But tonight, I had a good conversation with my parents about this. <br>
<br>
Overall, I think I realized two things about myself: <br>
<br>
1) I worry too much. There is so much to be excited about for law school. Going to an incredible university with incredible people (classmates and professors). Moving to a new geography on the west coast. I realized I worry too much when I was trying to understand the merits of law school with my dad. I was and am very caught up in the weeds: getting good grades, competing with classmates, looking for jobs. From my dad's POV, it was an incredible opportunity and privilege to keep learning for the sake of learning and maturing. To try my best and that's it. I do think my dad's POV is a bit pie-in-the-sky and privileged, but it merits a good point at the very least in terms of the attitude I should have toward school - to just be excited about learning and the many unknown opportunities that await.
<br>
2) I hold too tightly to a false notion of perfection. I think I have this false notion that so far, I have followed a life of near perfection: Yale, GS, and now SLS. And each step of the way, it is about hitting the "ideal" next thing. I feel like this is severely clouding my outlook on the future. <br>
It yields this ever-present fear of failure, and subsequently, unnecessary stress and anxiety. Even now, I am worrying about getting good grades in classes, getting an internship in healthcare litigation, etc. <br>
It limits my upside - once I hit the goal, I kind of just stop thinking about more things. After getting into SLS, I rest easy, play valorant, workout, and just chill. <br>
It makes me procrastinate - the need to do "big tasks" well, like the GSB app, makes me more inclined to procrastinate, relative to smaller lower stakes tasks like activating a credit card. <br>
<br>
Thoughts now on attitude going into law school: I don't think I will be able to just turn on a switch and waltz into school happily and carefree. So I guess it'll be like this - when it's hard I'll have to walk by faith, and when it's easy I'll do my best to enjoy it. <br>
<br>

<br>
Birthdays are opportunities for reflection. I think as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to realize it’s okay that birthdays aren’t these huge events. They don’t have to be a day of extraordinary happiness. They don’t have to be full of people and partying. I think as you get older, actually, less and less people celebrate with you. Your circles get smaller, even if the total number of circles you’ve touched continues to increase. I think what matters is that you cherish and hold tightly to those who are in your circle. Time separates, but time also prunes. <br>
<br>
This time last year, I had a vague sense that I would be in law school, and felt generally confident about the future. I think I am still generally optimistic. In the last year, I quit my job at GS (my first job out of college), moved away from NYC (although who knows, maybe I’ll go back), lived at home for several months, played a lot of Valorant, and then, of course, did law school. The day to day can be a grind, but overall, I think I’m pretty happy with where I am. Well, maybe happy isn’t the best word. Content. <br>
<br>
Still, I think I agree with myself from a year ago. I no longer really wish to get older. But I guess that’s a part of maturing. <br>
<br>
In the year ahead, I want to be more present in the present, and I want to show more grace to myself. I can be more engaged with the people I’m surrounded by and the circumstances I’m currently in. I can be less hard on myself while being more patient with others. <br>
<br>
Cheers to 25. <br>
<br>
<br>
2/27/23 <br>
<br>
Day before 26th birthday. If I am being completely honest, I don't really look forward to birthdays at all. I wish time would just slow down. I miss the naivety of being younger. Now, it just feels like more expectations and more responsibilities. And yet, currently, I still have so much agency. <br>
<br>
Objectively, my day-to-day is really great. At the moment, I only have class two days a week. I have a lot of free time to spend however I want. Movies, computer games, gym, basketball, golf, tennis. Even new things I am hoping to pursue like snowboarding. Looking for jobs. <br>
<br>
But I still feel a sense of emptiness or loneliness. On emptiness - I think that just living a comfortable life is not very satisfying. Maybe part of it is that I need to learn to embrace a slower pace, to embrace rest, to embrace and enjoy a quiet period. On the other hand, perhaps I need a little bit more to feel a sense of fulfillment. On loneliness - community in law school has not been great recently. In my head, I think I do have a lot of friends here - I can count them. But in reality, it just feels like people are really busy all the time. Other people may value community, but for them, it doesn't take priority over other things like school. I find myself constantly desiring a greater sense of connectivity with my friends and peers. Maybe next year at GSB will be better. Or, maybe I just need to cultivate a greater satisfaction from being alone and being with myself. <br>
<br>
I also feel a great weight with the anticipation of engagement and married. I love my girlfriend. She is kind, thoughtful, and brilliant. And yet, the gravity of marriage weighs heavily on my entire being. I don't think I want to break up. But I'm not sure that moving forward is necessarily healthy. I think that I am just hoping that with time, I will grow into it. There is this unsolveable balance between rising up to the occasion and backing down in acknowledgement of my own hesitation. I do not know which is the right answer. <br>
<br>
All in all, because of these reasons, I feel that I am at a strange crossroads in my life. I cannot foresee what the year ahead of me will look like. And still, I grow older. I guess I am 26 now. <br>
