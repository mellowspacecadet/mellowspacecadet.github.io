first week back from protected vacation <br>
- not too bad of a week <br>
- a couple of teams are going live though <br>
- jen arrived! <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- fairly chill week work-wise <br>
- a bit less jittery (didn't really feel any "sunday scaries") <br>
- happy that jen is here <br>
- still feels like time is frozen, stuck in a sea of monotony <br>
- still triggered by one team <br>
- progress on remaining apps feels sluggish <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- have a hunch the next couple of weeks might get really busy with multiple teams going live <br>
- try to stay at peace / not so easily angered or flustered <br>
- try to progress apps when I can <br>

A successful businessman on vacation was at the pier of a small coastal village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The businessman complimented the fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.
<br>
The fisherman proudly replied, “Every morning, I go out in my boat for 30 minutes to fish. I’m the best fisherman in the village”.
<br>
The businessman, perplexed, then asks the fisherman “If you’re the best, why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish? What do you do the rest of the day?”
<br>
The fisherman replied “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, spend quality time with my wife, and every evening we stroll into the village to drink wine and play guitar with our friends. I have a full and happy life.”
<br>
The businessman scoffed, “I am successful CEO and have a talent for spotting business opportunities. I can help you be more successful. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats with many fishermen. Instead of selling your catch to just your friends, you can scale to sell fish to thousands. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to the big city, where you can oversee your growing empire.”
<br>
The fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”
<br>
To which the businessman replied, “15 – 20 years.”
<br>
“But what then?” Asked the fisherman.
<br>
The businessman laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
<br>
“Millions – then what?”
<br>
The businessman said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, spend time with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your friends.”

reflections on 2020 (written on 12/31/20) <br>
- a year dominated by work and COVID <br>
- looking back on old texts, I do think I have grown since college, in a maturing way <br>
- generally more seasoned of a person <br>
- I would like to think I am more emotionally resilient <br>
- have been remote/WFH/quarantining for around 10 months now <br>
- a lot of what I learned came out of the struggles of work: learning to handle adversity, not being in control <br>
- in a word: resilience <br>
<br>
chronological breakdown of 2020 <br>
- 1. Jan-Mar: coming off tough work project, into birthday <br>
- 2. Mar-Jun: COVID starting (what the heck is going on?), living with Nan and Aaron, TFT <br>
- 3. Jun-Sep: came home, very tough work project, combined with stress about law school apps; extreme feelings of time scarcity <br>
- 4. Sep-Dec: progressively chiller, work not as bad, submitted law school apps, lots of Discord/League/ARAM/NBA <br>
<br>
things I did <br>
- read Bible daily since last New Year (read Genesis through 1 Samuel) <br>
- hit Diamond 2 in TFT; played a lot of ARAM; started Valorant <br>
- read a few books: The Defining Decade, Little Fires Everywhere, Becoming <br>
- moved back home (temporarily) <br>
- lots of walks <br>
<br>
what I'm looking forward to in 2021 <br>
- quitting investment banking <br>
- starting law school (COVID permitting) or a new job (hopefully healthcare startup related) <br>
- being with friends and in community again <br>
- basically, a change of scenery <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- chill week with New Year's <br>
- talked with fam about plans for pest control business <br>
<br>
+++ Pest Control Meeting Notes 1/1/21 +++ <br>
- a few possible paths: <br>
- 1. sell business <br>
- 2. partner/merge business (potentially with Wylie business) <br>
- 3. run out the business, then stop <br>
- 4. hire technicians and formalize the business <br>
- plan for now: try to hire technicians by October; run business until 65; then look to partner <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- made a new friend at the Murphy tennis courts // went to hit by myself, but another guy there was too, so I asked to play together <br>
- I have a strong sense of how things "should" be, and deviations from that are a source of discontentment. examples below: <br>
- - on Friday night, I "should" be socializing or with friends (over discord games or whatever); if not, feel sad and lonely <br>
- - on Thursday night, I "should" get off at a reasonable time and have time to rest; working late into the night very upsetting <br>
- - on Saturday night, I "should" be using time to spend with dad; if I'm doing something in my room, I feel guilty <br>
- - I "should" have the chance to go on walks with my parents, to watch sermons on Sunday, to eat meals peacefully, to rest and unplug from work <br>
- finished reading Brave New World <br>
- a challenging week toward the back end, working on an IPO pitch, went to bed at 5am ET Thursday night; felt trapped, stressed, dreamed about work <br>
- things that made me happy: sleeping in, cooking noodles with dad, facetiming jen, first snowfall of the year on Sunday! <br>
- watched a relevant sermon today about trusting in God amidst uncertainty and anxiety <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- first wave of HLS acceptances released tomorrow; fingers crossed; a bit nervous // keeping my peace either way <br>
- hopefully calmer after submission of IPO pitch tomorrow <br>
<br>

1/14/21 (special edition entry) <br>
<br>
Today I got into Stanford Law School. It was almost noon, and I was doing work, when I got the call. Upon seeing the 650 area code, I paused, then answered. It was the dean of the school. The phone call ended up lasting 4 minutes, but it felt like forever. The whole time I was pretty shaken and pacing back and forth in my room. After much anticipation, I was delightfully shook. <br>
<br>
People joke that getting into law school is the happiest part of law school. I definitely felt happy - happier than I felt getting into college. At the same time, life goes on. Still more work to do, and the same desires that affected me the day before still affect me today: longing for community, appreciating my family, enjoying good food and company. Don't get me wrong. I am very very excited, for the education, for the people I'll meet, for the opportunities I don't even know of yet; for Stanford! But, I have been praying that whether I get good or bad news during this application cycle, that I would keep my peace. <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>

- caught up with some friends (David, Xindi, Deanna, Chris) and told them about Stanford <br>
- lots of valorant and crossword puzzles with friends <br>
- fishing was good to get outdoors <br>

1/25/21 (written on a Monday because yesterday was challenging) <br>
<img src ="jan23schedule.jpeg" height="200">
<img src ="jan25tea.jpeg" height="200">
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- a thoroughly tough week of work (weekdays plus Sunday yesterday). started and ended rough <br>
- frustrated with work and the people at work, who seem unreasonable or are not doing their part <br>
- frustrated with the culture of banking - the equation is: <br>
- - assuming we achieve X, analysts then work as much as needed to achieve that (late nights, weekends, inefficient iterations) <br>
- - instead, it should be assuming a finite analyst amount of labor (assuming sustainability), what is the best we can achieve? <br>
- took today Monday off. sent an email in the early morning: "Due to personal health reasons, will be offline today. Thank you for your understanding" <br>
- - physical health: have not been sleeping well due to stress, have been experiencing chest tightness/pain and shortness of breath <br>
- - mental health: frustrated, stressed <br>
- - part of it is making a statement: I dare you to challenge me on this <br>
- - hopefully the start of a conversation on wellbeing. maybe not. <br>
- - how I spent the day: slept in, cleaned bathroom, vacuumed room, ate chipotle, looked at law school financial aid info, played tennis, dinner with dad, washed dishes <br>
- with that said, Saturday was really, really nice (see photo). only wish that I had more time, not how I spent it <br>
- got into upenn, uchicago, and columbia law (full-ride @ columbia)... don't think I've really processed this <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- funny how last week I said "try to stay calm with work"; I guess that's my hope for this week too <br>
<br>
<br>
1/31//21 <br>
(written one or two days ago) my dad said that during hard times, it can be helpful to think "at least..." <br>
i.e., even though X is bad, at least Y <br>
so here goes for this week. context is had a follow-on blow up Thursday night, launching Monday <br>
- at least it's a follow-on and not an M+A process <br>
- at least diligence calls were suggested for Sunday, not Saturday <br>
- at least we get to do abbreviated memos <br>
- at least it's a good team <br>
- at least it's an interesting company doing good science <br>
- at least the company is scheduling around pacific time, meaning less early meetings <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- thinking about writing these entries on Saturdays instead of Sundays <br>
- recent Sundays have been so busy with work, they feel like a new week, not a point of pause and reflection <br>
- this week I abruptly took two days off for personal health (chest tightness and pain, shortness of breath): physical and mental health <br>
- got rolled off my least favorite team, but haven't had a chance to process this and be happy about it yet <br>
- follow-on deal blew up Thursday night, launching tomorrow (Monday)  morning <br>
- feel like I just can't catch a break <br>
- nonetheless, still trying to remember the good things <br>
- - took two days off <br>
- - played Valorant and catan with friends <br>
- - went to Bob Woodruff park with friends <br>
- - quality time with dad <br>
- - connected with my sister talking about mental health <br>
- - scheduled a mental health appointment <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- please let there be rest <br>

- good long Sat: woke up at 530am to go fishing, played tennis in the afternoon, discord and games with friends in the evening <br>

- bit checked out at work <br>
- one of my fave associates leaving <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>
- taking a 4 day weekend: Friday off for Chinese New Year, into Monday President's day holiday <br>
- don't really remember the work week, which I guess is good because it means I'm relatively distanced from it <br>
- thankful to spend Chinese New Year at home with family, and taking days off from work <br>
- also Valentine's day this week, glad to spend it with jen virtually <br>
- even more jaded and unmotivated with work than before; feel like I can or should quit any day <br>
- think I have had too much discord games, especially valorant. need to take a break from it <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- one more day off tomorrow <br>
- hopefully fairly chill <br>

- no power, no internet, no cell service <br>
- I kind of liked it; time froze; just chilling with fam; reading books; sleep early and wake up late <br>
- started and finished reading Interior Chinatown <br>
- originally took last Friday off for CNY, turned into not working for 9 days due to the outages <br>
- feels harder and harder to get back into the work of investment banking <br>
- oh, and spent real life money on a valorant celestian phantom skin lol <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- well, back to work after what has unintentionally amounted to the length of a protected vacation <br>
- try to keep my calm despite all my misgivings of working in investment banking, trauma(?) from overwork, the work life culture, etc. <br>

turned 24! <br>
<br>
reflections on turning 24 <br>
I think as I've grown older, and especially this year, I don't really look forward to birthdays much anymore. I think I would prefer to stop growing up now, and in general, growing up seems tough. Communities and friendships are less easily accessible, you have to start taking on greater life responsibilities, and you have to craft your own path. Plus, your parents are getting older. Nonetheless, I am thankful for birthdays as a time to reflect, a time to be grateful, and a time to connect with friends.<br>
<br>
things I'm thankful for as I turn 24 <br>
- family (mom and dad, sister, brother-in-law, and niece) that love me and support me, and have sacrificed to provide for a better life for me <br>
- a loving, kind, and thoughtful girlfriend <br>
- friends (from childhood, from high school, from college, from discord games, and even a few from work) <br>
- a job that pays well and has good benefits <br>
- acceptances to Stanford and Harvard law schools, among others <br>
- a general feeling of confidence as I look ahead to the near future; even if not always happy or optimistic, a general sense that the future outlook is at least alright <br>
- quitting ib in a few months <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- not too bad a week after being offline a whole week due to Texas storm outages <br>
- thankful for friends and a birthday to reminisce on the past year and years <br>
- just starting to get inklings of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with work <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- try to find a little joy each day; try to have peace at work; try to have kindness with friends; try to have thoughtfulness with family and loved ones <br>

written on 3/23/21 because I forgot to do this yesterday <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- made the decision to take the policy research job <br>
- work was fine <br>
- two notable events <br>
- - 1. shooting in Atlanta of primarily asian women <br>
- - 2. GS survey of terrible working conditions got reported in all the major news outlets <br>
- for both of these, what will change? I do not know or see anything <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- quit and unquit my job (long story short, would have been required to take a month long garden period) <br>
- - 1) did not want to reduce the already-short time at the research place <br>
- - 2) did not want to be idle for a month yet, want to take that time right before starting school <br>
- - thinking of this as a resetting point; 3 more months until the finish line; basically just an internship's worth of time left <br>
- - my friend says "the best days are still ahead" - I think this is true, especially as we get closer to the end <br>
- pretty chill week of work <br>
- glad to have gone fishing with my parents yesterday <br>
- the notion of making plans for the wedding in May and returning to NYC is exciting <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- none, to be honest <br>
- Good Friday and Easter next weekend <br>

Good Friday and Easter weekend <br>

reflections on the week prior <br>
- chill week plus 3 day weekend <br>
- honestly, feeling ennui and a bit lonely - not really doing much or have much planned <br>
- at the very least, time is passing by, and bringing me closer to when I quit GS <br>
- happy spending time with jen, watching movies/TV/youtube, doing avengers/fast food tier lists <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- try to hold it down following this nice long weekend <br>
- request protected vacation for May <br>
