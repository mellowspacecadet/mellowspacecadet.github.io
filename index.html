just took a week off for protected vacation <br>
- good reminder that there is a life outside of work and that banking is not normal <br>
- returning back to baseline/normal state <br>
- re-realization of mild depression <br>
<br>
how to spend a sabbath? <br>
- watching sermons <br>
- listening to music <br>
- journaling/reflecting <br>
- no reddit/forums/twitch/social media during the day <br>
- simultaneously 1) not worried about maximizing time 2) not doing activities that make time just blur by <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- great to be able to disconnect from work <br>
- first feeling of time affluence since starting the job <br>
- chilled, submitted apps, went into nature <br>
- slept 9-10 hours every day <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- try to have somewhat of a good attitude <br>
- try to be ok feeling all emotions, not let them control me <br>
- slowly progress a few remaining apps <br>

first week back from protected vacation <br>
- not too bad of a week <br>
- a couple of teams are going live though <br>
- jen arrived! <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- fairly chill week work-wise <br>
- a bit less jittery (didn't really feel any "sunday scaries") <br>
- happy that jen is here <br>
- still feels like time is frozen, stuck in a sea of monotony <br>
- still triggered by one team <br>
- progress on remaining apps feels sluggish <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- have a hunch the next couple of weeks might get really busy with multiple teams going live <br>
- try to stay at peace / not so easily angered or flustered <br>
- try to progress apps when I can <br>
