first week back from protected vacation <br>
- not too bad of a week <br>
- a couple of teams are going live though <br>
- jen arrived! <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- fairly chill week work-wise <br>
- a bit less jittery (didn't really feel any "sunday scaries") <br>
- happy that jen is here <br>
- still feels like time is frozen, stuck in a sea of monotony <br>
- still triggered by one team <br>
- progress on remaining apps feels sluggish <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- have a hunch the next couple of weeks might get really busy with multiple teams going live <br>
- try to stay at peace / not so easily angered or flustered <br>
- try to progress apps when I can <br>

A successful businessman on vacation was at the pier of a small coastal village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The businessman complimented the fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.
<br>
The fisherman proudly replied, “Every morning, I go out in my boat for 30 minutes to fish. I’m the best fisherman in the village”.
<br>
The businessman, perplexed, then asks the fisherman “If you’re the best, why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish? What do you do the rest of the day?”
<br>
The fisherman replied “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, spend quality time with my wife, and every evening we stroll into the village to drink wine and play guitar with our friends. I have a full and happy life.”
<br>
The businessman scoffed, “I am successful CEO and have a talent for spotting business opportunities. I can help you be more successful. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats with many fishermen. Instead of selling your catch to just your friends, you can scale to sell fish to thousands. You could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to the big city, where you can oversee your growing empire.”
<br>
The fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”
<br>
To which the businessman replied, “15 – 20 years.”
<br>
“But what then?” Asked the fisherman.
<br>
The businessman laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”
<br>
“Millions – then what?”
<br>
The businessman said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, spend time with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your friends.”

reflections on 2020 (written on 12/31/20) <br>
- a year dominated by work and COVID <br>
- looking back on old texts, I do think I have grown since college, in a maturing way <br>
- generally more seasoned of a person <br>
- I would like to think I am more emotionally resilient <br>
- have been remote/WFH/quarantining for around 10 months now <br>
- a lot of what I learned came out of the struggles of work: learning to handle adversity, not being in control <br>
- in a word: resilience <br>
<br>
chronological breakdown of 2020 <br>
- 1. Jan-Mar: coming off tough work project, into birthday <br>
- 2. Mar-Jun: COVID starting (what the heck is going on?), living with Nan and Aaron, TFT <br>
- 3. Jun-Sep: came home, very tough work project, combined with stress about law school apps; extreme feelings of time scarcity <br>
- 4. Sep-Dec: progressively chiller, work not as bad, submitted law school apps, lots of Discord/League/ARAM/NBA <br>
<br>
things I did <br>
- read Bible daily since last New Year (read Genesis through 1 Samuel) <br>
- hit Diamond 2 in TFT; played a lot of ARAM; started Valorant <br>
- read a few books: The Defining Decade, Little Fires Everywhere, Becoming <br>
- moved back home (temporarily) <br>
- lots of walks <br>
<br>
what I'm looking forward to in 2021 <br>
- quitting investment banking <br>
- starting law school (COVID permitting) or a new job (hopefully healthcare startup related) <br>
- being with friends and in community again <br>
- basically, a change of scenery <br>
<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- chill week with New Year's <br>
- talked with fam about plans for pest control business <br>
<br>
+++ Pest Control Meeting Notes 1/1/21 +++ <br>
- a few possible paths: <br>
- 1. sell business <br>
- 2. partner/merge business (potentially with Wylie business) <br>
- 3. run out the business, then stop <br>
- 4. hire technicians and formalize the business <br>
- plan for now: try to hire technicians by October; run business until 65; then look to partner <br>

<br>
reflections on the week prior <br>
- made a new friend at the Murphy tennis courts // went to hit by myself, but another guy there was too, so I asked to play together <br>
- I have a strong sense of how things "should" be, and deviations from that are a source of discontentment. examples below: <br>
- - on Friday night, I "should" be socializing or with friends (over discord games or whatever); if not, feel sad and lonely <br>
- - on Thursday night, I "should" get off at a reasonable time and have time to rest; working late into the night very upsetting <br>
- - on Saturday night, I "should" be using time to spend with dad; if I'm doing something in my room, I feel guilty <br>
- - I "should" have the chance to go on walks with my parents, to watch sermons on Sunday, to eat meals peacefully, to rest and unplug from work <br>
- finished reading Brave New World <br>
- a challenging week toward the back end, working on an IPO pitch, went to bed at 5am ET Thursday night; felt trapped, stressed, dreamed about work <br>
- things that made me happy: sleeping in, cooking noodles with dad, facetiming jen, first snowfall of the year on Sunday! <br>
- watched a relevant sermon today about trusting in God amidst uncertainty and anxiety <br>
<br>
plans for the week ahead <br>
- first wave of HLS acceptances released tomorrow; fingers crossed; a bit nervous // keeping my peace either way <br>
- hopefully calmer after submission of IPO pitch tomorrow <br>
<br>
